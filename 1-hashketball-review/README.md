## Intro to Ruby and MOD1 w/ Hashketball

- What is TDD?
- irb and binding.pry
- helper methods/separation of concerns/single source of truth 
- Iterators
  - each
    - grab each thing and do a thing to it 
    - but it returns the original object/array 
  - map
    - grab each thing and do a thing and pass that thing into a new array 
    - returns a different array from what it is iterating through 
  - find
    - look at every element and return the FIRST element that makes my condition true 
  - select
    - look at every element and return EVERY element that makes my condition true 
    - return all of those elements in an array 

  #Arrays 
    - Numbered lists 
    - Order matters 

  #Hashes 
    - Collect information about an "object"
