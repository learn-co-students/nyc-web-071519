# Intro to Object Orientation


#Question:
- Reduce 

## DRY

- Do Not Repeat Yourself

# What is an object?
    - Just a thing 

# How do objects work?

- methods and messages
  - a function that's inside of a class
  - a method is called on an object
  - a message is sent to an object

# What is a class?
    - The idea of an object 
    - Builds the common methods/behaviors of our instances 

# What is an instance?

- initialize
- getters and setters
- Ruby macros

# Goal: Teach Ruby what an animal is


- Objects vary 
- Individual objects can change 
- Even though objects can be individualized there are still common traits/characteristics/behaviors
