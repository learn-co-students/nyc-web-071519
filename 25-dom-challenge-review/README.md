# The DOM Challenge

To begin comment out the script tag linking to `index.min.js` in the html file.
Write your code in `challenge.js`

## Deliverables

1. As a user, I should see the timer increment every second once the page has loaded.
2. As a user, I can manually increment and decrement the counter as I like.
3. As a user, I can like an individual number of the counter. I should see the appropriate number of likes associated with that particular number.
4. As a user, I can pause the game, which should disable all buttons except the pause button. The pause button should then show the text "resume."
5. As a user, I can leave comments on my gameplay, such as: "Wow, what a fun game this is."

**Remember**: You might need to prevent default behavior with [`Event.preventDefault`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault)
